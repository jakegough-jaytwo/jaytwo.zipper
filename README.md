Just a simple utility class to work with the `ZipArchive` class in `System.IO.Compression`.  It took some trial 
and error to figure out how to create and extract zip files compatible with regular archives you'd create on a
windows machine.  So I thought I'd wrap it up into a NuGet package so I don't forget how to do it later.


## Installation

Add the NuGet package

```
PM> Install-Package jaytwo.zipper
```

## Usage

```csharp
//TODO
```
